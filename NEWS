Changes:

# HyRiM version 1.1.0 (release date t.b.a.)
=========================================================
Changes:
* replaced fictitious play by linear programming as the internal algorithm of mgss to now give exact solutions rather than only approximate ones
* CHANGE: accuracy parameter eps now measuring the change in the losses rather than the change in the mixed strategies along fictitious play
* added convenience access to game models by subsetting operators [,,] and [,,]<- as for matrices, vectors, etc.
* added support for real-valued multi-criteria games that use lexicographically ordered payoffs
* extended the function "disappointmentRate" to take matrix games over the reals and
  compute the disappointment rate directly for them, or for a given equilibrium therein
* added convenience function for extraction and replacement of parts of a game's payoff structure (in the usual R-syntax x[i,j,..] <- replacement, or x[i,j,k] for extraction)
* added an option "cleanUp = FALSE" to plot.mosg to retain the SVG file for subsequent use elsewhere (e.g., in papers)

# HyRiM version 1.0.4 (release date November 11 th, 2019)
=========================================================
Changes:
* added parameter "largeGame" to plot.mosg, to allow plotting of games of arbitrary size without errors on figure margins being too small

# HyRiM version 1.0.3 (release date November 11 th, 2019)
=========================================================
Changes:
* November 11th, 2019: bugfix in "mosg.lossdistribution"
* July 5th, 2019: added package vignette (extended documentation with many more detailed explanations, some hacks, etc.)
