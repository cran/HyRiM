Package history:
================

09.06.2021 (version 2.0.1) 
* BUGFIX: added tolerance parameter "tol" to function mgss, to account for roundoff errors behind the 5th digit after the comma when solving the linear programs
05.05.2021
* BUGFIX: in some cases, numeric roundoff errors encountered internally in the constraints of the LPs made the linear
  programs infeasible. Added an optional tolerance parameter "tol", defaulting to zero for exact solutions, but usable
  to fix the roundoff errors if needed.
09.04.2020 
* CHANGE: replaced fictitious play to compute approximate security strategies by an exact algorithm using linear programming. This will be version 2.0.0 of the package, 
pending for release over CRAN. It is no longer downwards compatible regarding the function <code>mgss</code> to code using version 1.x.x. Thanks to Ali Alshawish and Vincent BÃ¼rgin for reporting the 
convergence issues with fictitious play that led to this change.
* FEATURE: added support for real-valued multi-criteria games that use lexicographically ordered payoffs
* FEATURE: extended the function "disappointmentRate" to take matrix games over the reals and
  compute the disappointment rate directly for them, or for a given equilibrium therein
* FEATURE: added convenience function for extraction and replacement of parts of a game's payoff structure (in the usual R-syntax x[i,j,..] <- replacement, or x[i,j,k] for extraction)
* FEATURE: added an option "cleanUp = FALSE" to plot.mosg to retain the SVG file for subsequent use elsewhere (e.g., in papers)
11.11.2019:
* BUGFIX: error in "moment" function; thankfully submitted (with correction) by Ali Alshawish
18.07.2019:
* FEATURE: added vignette paper (displayable via 'RShowDoc("vignette", type="pdf", package="HyRiM")')
04.09.2018:
* BUGFIX: function "mosg" incorrectly handled the parameter setting "byrow = FALSE"
* BUGFIX: "moment" was on categorical distributions incorrectly using "range" rather than "supp" 
26.07.2018:
* BUGFIX: games with numeric payoffs fail if one of the payoffs is an integer power of 10 (so that the internal distributions become degenerate in this case)
24.07.2018
* BUGFIX: preference function incorrectly ignored all but the last goal
18.04.2018
* FEATURE: added "disappointment rate" function
23.02.2018
* BUGFIX: preference function returned wrong results for relations between numbers and distributions
16.01.2018
* BUGFIX: preference among discrete distributions with different ranges but equal support was occasionally computed incorrectly
28.08.2017
* FEATURE: plot.mosg now takes arguments xlim and ylim to make all plots comparable by identical axes ranges
* BUGFIX: improvement to the implementation of density (now returns zero only for categories as they are specified; nothing more)
* BUGFIX: print.mosg did not list the goals by name (now does)
25.08.2017
* BUGFIX: density, when applied to continuous distributions, returned zero for vector arguments in some occasions
10.07.2017
* BUGFIX: "range" now properly updated after smoothing a density (previously, the range was set based on the data, but not updated after smoothing, which caused errors when moments were computed (visible by warning messages))
* FEATURE: if loss distributions with empty categories are supplied, the error now tells where the problem occurred in the game (row, column and goal)
